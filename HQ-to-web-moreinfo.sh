#This script creates web images from high quality JPEG images. Feel free to tweak as you wish.

#Requires: imagemagick, cwebp and jpegoptim.
#On most debian based distros you can install using: sudo apt-get install imagemagick webp jpegoptim

#Replace with proper directory.
#You can also replace the following line of code with: 'read -p "Enter path:" VIDEOS' (Don't include the single quotes.) if you want the script to ask you for a directory so you won't have to edit this file if you want to change the directory. (Not as safe.)

#Same as above but with the .jpeg file extension instead of the .jpg file extension. This does nothing if they are all in the .jpg file extension.
